⚠️ WARNING: To retain your saved data when updating versions be sure to make a backup of your current master.csv file and then replace the default one with it once you've downloaded the updated files. Maybe I'll get around to making it easier to update.

# How to use
Import free historical data from coincodex or previously exported data. It should work with any csv file as long as there is a column for start date, end date, open price, and close price.

Click Start to begin fetching and storing real-time data for Kaspa's price and hashrate.

Auto Start will click start for you when the app first starts.

If you don't want to use real-time data you can check mark Use only uploaded data.

Right mouse button will pan the chart.

Click and drag the left mouse button to zoom in on a specific area.

Middle mouse wheel zooms in/out.

Change the drop down menu to change the timespan of data shown in the chart. The number shown in the drop down menu's text box can actually be edited to further customize the data shown and the data exported will depend on this setting.
